            <p>As we grow up, we desperately feel the desire to belong â€“ that is natural. We may have begun to put on a facade and rejected our unique individuality in order to assimilate to societal expectations. However, what good will that do if we lose sight of ourselves?</p>

            <p>I was that girl in high school. As a migrant from the Philippines, I was ashamed of my style and fobby accent. Before high school began, I promised myself that I would do anything it takes to fit in with the "cool" kids â€“ whatever that meant.</p>

            <!-- <a href="#">

            <a href="#">
              <img class="img-fluid" src="/img/01-02-2018-fashion-02.jpg" alt="">
            </a>

            <p>As such, I changed my style to keep up with the latest trend, experimented with makeup, embarked on a strict diet to maintain my slender figure, participated in various clubs to meet new friends, and studied hard to not only acquire knowledge and achieve good grades but also to eradicate my fobby accent.</p>

            <blockquote class="blockquote">If you're already somebody who's feeling different, you'll do everything in your power to fix it because children will do everything in their power to fit in and assimilate.</blockquote>

            <p>Now you may think, "Wait, what she did was actually a good thing...I did not see a point where she was a horrible teenager." True, my introduction may have been deceitful, and you probably expected me to disclose a personal story about how I was a troublemaker and an addict.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Do Not Change Yourself; Improve Yourself</h2>

            <p>No, I never did drugs, smoked cigarettes, and drank alcohol. Sure, I wanted to change certain characteristics about myself to fit in with the other students. I want to rephrase what I said earlier â€“ Before high school began, I promised myself that I would do anything it takes to fit in with the "kids-with-a-future" crowd. I was strong-willed and I knew what was good for me and my future and what was bad that could ruin me for the rest of my life.</p>

            <a href="#">
              <img class="img-fluid" src="/img/01-02-2018-fashion-04.jpg" alt="">
            </a>

            <p>In hindsight, the one thing I would tell my younger self is to be less hard on yourself. My hard work and ambition allowed me to be where I am today; however, I exerted too much unnecessary stress on my younger self as I tried to change my image and individuality.</p>

            <blockquote class="blockquote">To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.</blockquote>

            <h2 class="section-heading">The Final Frontier</h2>

            <p>I understood the whole "do not change yourself" idea, in which I still try to apply in my life today. I prevent myself from interacting with those who do not contribute to my personal growth.</p>

            <blockquote class="blockquote">The conclusion bears repeating: Do not try to change yourselfâ€Šâ€”â€Šyou are unlikely to succeed. But work hard to improve the way you perform.</blockquote>

            <p>Do not change yourself. Never apologize for who you are. Rather, improve your strengths. We all live in a world that tries to turn you into something you are not. As such, society establishes standards about the way you should look and behave. If societal expectations cause you to be unhappy and are against your morals, then do not adjust yourself.</p>
