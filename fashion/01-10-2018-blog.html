            <p>As the New Year rolls around, many of us set out to make promises to better ourselves. Goals play a powerful force as they give us direction in life.</p>

            <p>Yet many people fail to follow through with their resolutions. But do not let their failure and lack of determination discourage you from achieving your goals. It is important to note that setting resolutions will help you grow significantly in both your personal and professional life. </p>

            <p>I am dedicating this blog to show you how to set your goals and how to achieve them. It is important to note that it is not just about setting goals and accomplishing them ‚Äì you have to pick the right and realistic goals. Additionally, I will also share with you my goals and how I break them up into smaller chunks.</p>

            <blockquote class="blockquote">New Year, New Feels, New Chances. Same Dreams, Fresh Starts.</blockquote>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Before Setting Your Goals</h2>

            <p>Before we start, ask yourself what would you like to have happen this year? What would you like to accomplish? What particular areas of growth would you like to improve on? What blocks would you like to remove?</p>

            <p>What little things would you like to achieve? What big things would you like to achieve? What would you like to have happen in your friendship, love life, and family life? What would you like to have happen in your career?</p>

            <p>Would you like to improve your health and lifestyle? Do you want to change the way you look? Do you want to learn something new?</p>

            <a href="#">
              <img class="img-fluid" src="/img/01-10-2018-fashion-02.jpg" alt="" style="transform: rotate(90deg); margin-top: 15%; margin-bottom: 15%;">
            </a>

            <p>Take a piece of paper and write it all down. This process will help you organize your overall thoughts into concrete wants and needs to help you easily determine which goals you would like to set for yourself for the year.</p>

            <p>Once you have an overall transformation in mind, break it down into concrete set of goals. For instance, one of my goals for the coming year is to improve my health and lifestyle. As such, I may choose to cut back on carbs and boba, eat more vegetables and fruits, hit the gym regularly, and use the sauna more often.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Set Goals</h2>

            <p>When setting your goals, focus on the following:</p>

            <p><ul>
              <li>Make your goals Specific, Measurable, Assignable, Realistic, and Time-related <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;">(SMART)</a></li>
              <li>Break the big picture into smaller goals (i.e. monthly goals)</li>
              <li>Do something every day to bring you closer to your goals</li>
              <li>Review and update your goals once per week</li>
            </ul></p>

            <blockquote class="blockquote">Your success and happiness lies in you. Resolve to keep happy, and your joy and you shall form an invincible host against difficulties.</blockquote>

            <p>I like to emphasize that the most crucial aspect to achieving your goals is to ‚Äúdo something every day.‚Äù It is a bad and unacceptable habit to think that postponing an activity for the next day will not make a huge difference.</p>

            <p>You will accomplish a lot more and be more productive if you do something every day as opposed to trying to do everything altogether over a weekend. Whatever your goals are, adopt a slow and steady approach.</p>

              <img class="img-fluid" src="/img/01-10-2018-fashion-03.jpg" alt="" style="transform: rotate(90deg); margin-top: 15%; margin-bottom: 15%;">
            </a>

            <h2 class="section-heading">My New Year's Resolutions</h2>

            <p>Here are the tentative goals I have set for myself for the year:</p>

            <p><ul>
              <li>Write cleaner code</li>
              <li>Improve skin care routine</li>
              <li>Adopt a healthier lifestyle</li>
              <li>Shop less...seriously</li>
              <li>Use keyboard shortcuts more often</li>
              <li>Spend more quality time with family</li>
            </ul></p>

            <p>And here is how I would organize my resolutions into monthly goals. For instance, in the first month, I set the following goals:</p>

            <blockquote class="blockquote">Every day is a chance to begin again. Don‚Äôt focus on the failures of yesterday, start today with positive thoughts and expectations.</blockquote>

            <p><ul>
              <li>Buy Clean Code by Robert C. Martin</li>
              <li>Read at least two chapters of Clean Code</li>
              <li>Dedicate a Friday for a one-day cleanse</li>
              <li>Incorporate more greens into meal prep</li>
              <li>Treat yourself to fried foods only 2 times</li>
              <li>Limit boba consumption to 5 times</li>
              <li>Exercise at least 4 times every week</li>
              <li>Sauna at least 3 times every week</li>
              <li>Do facial mask once every 2 weeks</li>
              <li>Do 10 sit ups for every mouse reliance instead of keyboard shortcuts</li>
            </ul></p>

            <a href="#">
              <img class="img-fluid" src="/img/01-10-2018-fashion-04.jpg" alt="" style="transform: rotate(90deg); margin-top: 15%; margin-bottom: 15%;">
            </a>

            <p>For every month thereafter, I may make slight changes to my list to get closer to my goals.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Final Message</h2>

            <p>Do not think about what will happen in the next few months or in a year ‚Äì just focus on the 24 hours in front of you and do what you can to get closer to where you want to be.</p>

            <p>Do not forget to review and update your goals weekly and continue working towards your goals. You will be surprised at how much you can accomplish and grow into a better human being in a year.</p>

            <p>Challenge yourself. Be ambitious. Put in the work. Watch yourself change for the better. Best of luck!</p>
