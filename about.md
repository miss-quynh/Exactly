I am a versatile, bilingual professional who develops a deep passion for computer programming, strives to radically simplify everyday tasks through technology, and is passionate about breaking the Silicon Valley stereotype. Additionally, I have the ability to oversee and approach a problem from a creative and innovative perspective to implement corrective processes.
