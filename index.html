<h2>About me:</h2>
<p>My name is <strong>Quynh Nguyen</strong>, and I am a student at DBC. I am part of the <em>Golden Bears</em> cohort, and I will be attending the San Francisco location. I was born and raised in the Philippines. My family and I arrived to the United States in November 2005, and we have been residing in San Jose. I lived in Berkeley for four years when I was an undergrad at Cal, then I moved back to the South Bay upon graduation. Currently, I am living in Sunnyvale and working in Santa Clara. Clearly, my heart belongs to the Bae. I have a younger sister, Mai Nguyen, who is a year younger than I, and a younger brother, Phu Nguyen, who is five years younger than I.
<br>
<br>
I am...
<br>
<ul>
  <li>extremely neat and organized</li>
  <li>straightforward</li>
  <li>energetic</li>
  <li>sociable</li>
  <li>amicable</li>
  <li>funny</li>
  <li>down-to-earth</li>
  <li>honest to a fault</li>
  <li>family-oriented</li>
  <li>a mature young lady who is a kid at heart</li>
</ul>
<br>
I enjoy outdoor activities as much as indoor activities:
<br>
<ol>
  <li>hiking</li>
  <li>biking</li>
  <li>rock climbing or bouldering</li>
  <li>bowling</li>
  <li>playing board games</li>
  <li>watching movies</li>
  <li>solving jigsaw puzzles</li>
  <li>singing and dancing despite being good at neither</li>
  <li>stuffing my face with AYCE KBBQ</li></p>
</ol>
<br>
In addition to staying active, I strive to maintain a healthy diet. As such, below is my meal plan for a typical week:
